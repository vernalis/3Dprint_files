# **Raspberry Pi Case**

## Summary

A modified version of a publicly available Raspberry Pi 4 case (<https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561>) was designed to accommodate RGB LCD shield (ADA716) – allowing headless operation of the device and containment of all components.

## Assembly Instructions

Case components were printed in PETG filament to provide good temperature resilience during operation even during high CPU usage. M2.5 sized nuts were inserted midway through the print of the top to allow the RGB LCD shield to be securely attached.

With the top part of the case face down, printed buttons were inserted from the inside. RGB LCD shield (ADA716) was then secured in place with four M2.5 bolts. Raspberry Pi 4 containing 16Gb SD card (with operating system pre-installed) was fitted into the base of the case. Once any additional hardware had been successfully added to the Raspberry Pi device the two halves of the case could be clipped together. Legs could then be stuck to the base of the case using superglue.
