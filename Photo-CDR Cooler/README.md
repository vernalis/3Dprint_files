## Assembly Instructions

Remove the printing support from underside of the compressed air input by twisting the plastic support along horizontal and vertical break lines. Affix appropriate connector to the compressed air supply line.
Line the inner of the Photo-CDR base with reflective mirror tape or foil to act as a reflector and using a polypropylene glue gun (or epoxy glue) apply glue to the lower rim and fix in position the mirror at the bottom of the Photo-CDR base
Line the inner face of the lower part of the lamp holder that will sit above the Photo-CDR with the reflective mirror tape or foil. Using the same glue gun or epoxy glue as previously, glue the top of the lower part of the bottom of the upper part of the lamp holder and leave to set secure
