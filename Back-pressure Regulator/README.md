## Assembly Instructions

### Components

- PTFE film 50 mm x 100 mm x 0.1 mm
- Filament Polypropylene
- 4 mm Push fit straight adapter M5
- 2 x ¼ 28 UNF hex nut
- 1 x M5 nut
- 2 x M4 hex socket bolts 35 mm length
- 2 x M4 wing nuts
- 1 x Silicone O ring 9.2 mm id

### STL files

**BPR - Back pressure regulator 1.stl**: Liquid face plate with two slots spaced 3.5 mm apart that will face the PTFE membrane (1 input and 1 output).

**BPR - Back pressure regulator 2.stl**: Gas face plate with single entry and domed recess to allow a void for the liquid to pass under the PTFE membrane. Additional recess for insertion of the silicone compression ring and this part faces the PTFE gasket.

Note that when printing the stl files there will need to be a pause inserted at the tops of the seating. This pause is to enable the nuts to be inserted manually prior to resuming the print and to embed the nuts within the print.
